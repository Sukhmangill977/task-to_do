This project includes a web application with support for dark and light themes, a profile section, a weather container, and a to-do section. It is designed with responsive features to ensure usability across various devices.

## Features

### Dark and Light Theme Support

- **Theme Switcher**: Toggle between dark and light themes to suit user preferences.
- **Container Background**: Dynamic background color changes based on the selected theme.
- **Text and Element Colors**: Text and interactive elements adjust colors according to the theme.

### Profile Section

- **Profile Display**: Responsive layout for user profiles with theme-adapted styles.
- **Profile Image**: Circular profile images with theme-based borders.
- **Logout Button**: Styled with theme-specific colors and transition effects.

### Weather Container

- **Weather Information**: Displays weather details with theme-specific styles.
- **Location Input**: Input fields and buttons for weather search that match the selected theme.

### To-Do Section

- **Task List**: Tasks are displayed with background colors and text that adapt to the theme.
- **Task Actions**: Action buttons (e.g., complete, delete) styled to fit the theme.
- **Form Inputs**: Input fields and buttons in the to-do form are theme-adapted.

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile Adaptation**: Ensures layout and theme settings are compatible with different device sizes.
- **Adjustable Elements**: Elements like buttons and inputs are resized and repositioned for mobile usability.

### Additional Features

- **Smooth Transitions**: Enhances user experience with smooth transitions for color changes and interactive elements.
- **Hover Effects**: Provides visual feedback on interactive elements with hover effects.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
